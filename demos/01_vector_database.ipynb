    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Tokenization\n",
    "    - \"The cat sat on the mat.\" → ['the', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'the', 'mat', '.']\n",
    "1. Each token is mapped to an ID (arbitrary integer) (from the model's vocabulary)\n",
    "    - ['the', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'the', 'mat', '.'] → [101, 4523, 3546, 1203, 101, 2981, 119]\n",
    "1. Embedding Layer (Word → Vector)\n",
    "    - Each token ID is looked up in a learned embedding table, which is just a matrix of floats.\n",
    "    - 101 might become:\n",
    "        - [0.01, 0.15, -0.23, ..., 0.07]  (384-dimensional vector)\n",
    "    - Each token ID is mapped to a dense (list or array where most or all values are non-zero) vector of floats — and these are learned during training.\n",
    "        - 'cat'  → [0.12, -0.8, 0.9, ...]\n",
    "        - 'dog'  → [0.11, -0.78, 0.91, ...]\n",
    "    - 'cat' and 'dog' have similar vectors — because they mean similar things.\n",
    "    - All tokens are now represented as vectors — these are initial word-level embeddings, but they don’t yet capture context or meaning beyond the word level.\n",
    "1. Transformer Layers\n",
    "    - Model applies attention mechanisms to process all tokens together, layer by layer.\n",
    "    - At each layer, each word’s vector is updated based on:\n",
    "        - What other words are nearby\n",
    "        - The relationships between words (e.g. subjects, objects, actions)\n",
    "        - Learned patterns from training on massive amounts of text\n",
    "    - After several layers (e.g. 6 in MiniLM), the vectors become contextualized:\n",
    "        - \"cat\" knows it’s the subject\n",
    "        - \"sat\" knows it’s a verb referring to the cat\n",
    "    - This is what gives the model its understanding of meaning.\n",
    "1. Pooling / Sentence Embedding\n",
    "    - Once each word has a contextual vector, you combine them into a single vector for the whole sentence.\n",
    "    - This could be done using:\n",
    "        - The vector for the [CLS] token\n",
    "            - Many transformer models (like BERT) add a special token [CLS] at the start of every input.\n",
    "        - Mean pooling (average of all token vectors)\n",
    "            - Take the average (mean) of all token embeddings (excluding special tokens like [PAD] or [SEP]).\n",
    "            - Gives equal weight to every word in the sentence.\n",
    "        - Max pooling\n",
    "            - For each dimension in the embedding vector, pick the maximum value across all token vectors.\n",
    "            - Think of it as capturing the most strongly activated (strongest signal) feature.\n"
